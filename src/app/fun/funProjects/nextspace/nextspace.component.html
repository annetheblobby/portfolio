    <h2>Urbanist architecture of the future will predict the social and economic concerns that are extensions of current trends. These include downscaling or movement out of cities, a massive advance of in-home technology and the shift in global power away from the western powers towards the east. These themes influence each other in a multidirectional relationship and Next Space is a 3D SketchUp model that ties together the above trends. </h2>

    <h3>A retreat away from the bustle of the city.</h3>
    <blockquote>"The city is wherever the citizen is"- Frank Lloyd Wright</blockquote>
    <p>Modern, iconic architecture mostly situates itself within the city, and although the city is still a major hub of innovation of growth for architecture, there is a rejuvenated interest in spaces away from the bustle of city life. The city has often been concerned with economic segregation, higher levels of crime, and rising house pricing.  In European and North American countries, the percentage of one-parent households has risen, and couples are having children much later. This makes for smaller households and a decrease in income. To accommodate the trend of high house pricing and smaller households, Next Space is comprised of smaller spaces that can be as small as 75 square meters but is modular and can expand depending on the usage of the space or family expansion. </p>
    <h4>The Next Space complex is built in the context of a suburb and one of the draws of suburbia is the distinct idea of freedom and space. Newly acquired fears of crowded buses, trains, stores and parks (collective enochlophobia) is predicted to occur after to the Covid-19 pandemic. To combat a growing aversion to crowds and packed spaces and to promote outdoor activities, the complex has close access to parks and communal nature space surrounds each house. More outdoor space around the house itself can also be configured by the owner with simple modular transformations.</h4>

    <h5><em>Fig 2.  The first configuration extends the living area for an increased communal area and converts bedrooms into social/movie rooms to make the space optimal for large gatherings. The second configuration depicts family time and resting time configuration while the third configuration extends the bedrooms out into fold out office spaces. The storage unit of the bed can be rolled to act as a divider between rooms.</em></h5>
    <h3>Technology and sustainable, inclusive living.</h3>
    <p>The making of the Next Space community is optimized with the use of smart technology. Technological development is accelerating, and the presence of technology is becoming more and more involved with our homes, often interacting with our daily living experiences. This is particularly evident with the emergence of the smart living concept (Sidewalk Toronto, 2019). 
        One example is our reliance on google home or other IOT devices that enable homeowners to manipulate their home appliances through a centralized application.</p>
    <h4>The Next Space accommodates all house changes using a wall mounted smart projector that changes the room depending on the time of day, owner specification, or other factors. Other changes can be automatic such as the change to the slant of the roof, allowing windows to let in as much light in as possible. Additionally, ambient technology around the house and projectors decrease the need for screens and digital interfaces such as television or phones. Monitoring from IOT floor sensors or sound sensors may also serve as a health service and would be able to detect sounds of distress and notify other family members for help. </h4>

    <h5><em>Fig 3. (from IDEO) An example of a smart projection interface. Fig 4.  The item mounted on the wall is a projection system and can also facilitate ambient detection and alerts (right).</em></h5>
    <p>City infrastructure and neighborhoods are also becoming smarter, especially in 'smart cities', cities constructed by large technology corporations that espouse the optimal way of living through enhanced technological advances. These technological ecosystems imitate Silicon Valley corporate office designs such as the Apple's futuristic green campus. PWC estimates the global smart cities market will exceed US$2.5 trillion by 2025.</p>
    <p>Suburbs are starting to adopt many attributes from smart cities. One of the main motives of smart living is environmental realism, founded on the idea that "rational science can and will provide the understanding of the environment and the assessment of those measures which are necessary to rectify environmental bads”.  </p>
    <p>This includes maximizing the use of solar energy and capturing daylight instead of using artificial light (such as using an ambient technology sensor to change roof tilt), using natural ventilation, and automatically shut off systems. </p>
    <h4>The modular designs of Next Spaces housing make it possible for entire rooms to be prefabricated, decreasing building waste and carbon emissions of transporting materials.</h4>
    <img class="process" src="assets/fun/roof.jpg">
    <h5><em>Fig.5  The roof configuration changes in the direction of tilt depending on the suns location so that the solar window and solar panel recieves as much energy as possible throughout the day.</em></h5>
    <p>However, technological considerations also need to be balanced by social considerations, for instance, incorporating pedestrianization into streets by widening sidewalks and decreasing neighborhood car speeds by narrowing the road.</p> 
    <h4>The concept design places green spaces around the houses and community gardens. New urbanism reflects upon antiquated notions of modernity with nostalgia for nature and the space designed for the building complex encourages walking interactions to connect the residents to connect with nature and the people around the community. The design modularity also stresses the importance of accessibility, as owners can choose building spaces with no stairs or any other features that suit their lifestyle.</h4>

    <h5><em>Fig 6.  All the lights in the neighborhood are sound / motion sensitive and dim when no one is using them.</em></h5>
    <img class="process" src="assets/fun/common space.jpg">
    <h5><em>Fig.7  There are walking paths throughout the complex and a dedicated heated biking and walking lane on the main roads to encourage healthy exercise and carbon free transportation. Similar to the modular concept of the houses in the complex, the blocks in the common area are able to contort to multiple shapes for different usages (gardening, play structure, chair, table).</em></h5>
   
    <h3>Shifts in global interests to a shift in architectural inspiration.</h3>
    <p>In <em>The Globalization of Modern Architecture</em>, Robert Adam predicts that emerging architecture may come from rapidly developing eastern countries such as China. Architects working in global cities in China aim to promote international tourism and in order to achieve their goals, projects are modern, high tech, and futuristic, which conveniently lends itself easily to a 'smart-city' design.</p>
    <h4>The style of the houses conforms to the modernist design blueprint- simple square shapes and extensive use of glass. However, the entire housing complex borrows influence from traditional Chinese architecture. For instance, it loosely incorporates the concept of Siheyuan, which is an inner courtyard that helps block residents from harsh weather as well as maintain communal culture within the residents. To balance the need to connect with the desire for privacy, rows of greenery help make a distinction between private and public. </h4>

    <h5><em>Fig 8.  Model of the courtyard inspired by traditional Chinese Siheyuan. As some power shifts to the east, it is possible that culture in the west could also be influenced, for instance, a shift in emphasis on community over privacy.</em></h5>

    <h3>Outcomes.</h3>
    <blockquote>“We need to find multidisciplinary solutions to the great challenges of our time in order to continue to live and thrive on this planet.” - Kjetil Trædal Thorsen</blockquote> 
    <p>The suburban landscape is currently evolving to match changes in our culture and society. The solutions Next Space offer, such as modular living, conservation of green space, technological advances and cultural exchange, combine to confront modern socio-economic challenges and ultimately strive to improve future living standards.</p>
